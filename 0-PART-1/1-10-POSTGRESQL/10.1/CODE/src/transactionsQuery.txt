RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS

relationships let you store data in different tables and relate it with each other

MONGODB:

since mongo is a no sql db you can store any shape of data in it .
we can store it in an object that has the address detail

SQL: 

since sql can not store object as such we nned to define 2 different tables to sotre thhis data in

using forign key we can quering the data with 2 different tables for ex let user 1
has 2 we dont need to store the data same user in one table instead using the different table 


CREATE TABLE address(
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    pincode VARCHAR(20),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFUALT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE

)

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

insert into address(user_id,city,sountry, street, pincode) values (1,'new york','usa' '12321 st','1001')

SELECT city, country, street, pincode
FROM addresses
WHERE user_id = 1;

This would require transactions  in SQL to ensure either both the user information and address goes in, or neither does
SQL Query
BEGIN; -- Start transaction

INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('john_doe', 'john_doe1@example.com', 'securepassword123');

INSERT INTO addresses (user_id, city, country, street, pincode)
VALUES (currval('users_id_seq'), 'New York', 'USA', '123 Broadway St', '10001');

COMMIT;
